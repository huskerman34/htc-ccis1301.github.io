<h2>Requirements</h2>
There are a few things you need right away in order to be successful in this course:

<ol>
  <li>The textbook - Basics of Web Design: HTML5 &amp; CSS3 - Third Edition by Terry Felke-Morris (ISBN-10: 0133970744 ). The assigned reading from the textbook explains most key concepts. This site will not repeat that information, only provide supplementary material. Renting the textbook is a fine option, or if you purchased it, consider selling it back.  It is a great learning tool, but there are better web resources for later use.</li>

  <li>An editor with syntax highlighting, such as Brackets. While other editors will work, I would encourage you to use Brackets for this course. It runs a web server (Node.js) under the covers which will better support some of the later topics, and it will be used in the JavaScript course as well.</li>

  <li>A GitHub account. We will be working with git and GitHub to develop our projects throughout this course. Set yourself up with an account - I encourage you to use your actual name, then follow me (mbMosman). I will then add you to the course Organization so that you can access our team repositories.</li>

  <li>A Slack account for the <a href="https://htc-ccis1301.slack.com/signup">course team</a>. You must use your my.hennepintech.edu email address to join the team. Slack will be used for class discussion and communication.  It is your best tool for asking questions and getting help from classmates or instructors.</li>
</ol>
