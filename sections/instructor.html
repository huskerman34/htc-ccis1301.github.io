    <h2>Office Hours</h2>
    <p>
      To get one-on-one assistance with coursework, it is strongly recommended that you contact me to arrange a specific time to meet. If you just drop by, you may find I am working with someone else or that there is not enough time available to address your concerns. During high-traffic periods, for example right before an assignment is due, I may need to limit my time to 10-15 minutes per student, in order to allow time for everyone.
