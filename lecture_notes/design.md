## Web Design
In industry there web development is often split into two groups:  the designers & the developers.  The distinctions between the groups can often be blurred, with some people filling both roles, but it is common (especially with larger, commercial projects) to have both roles addressed separately.  On smaller projects however, it is not uncommon for one person to fill both roles, or to have the design tasks distributed throughout the team.

Web Designers, are like graphic designers for print.  They are often the artists, the creative inspiration behind the design. They may also have an understanding of web specific issues, such as site usability, accessibility and responsive design, but this is not always the case. They to use wireframe tools to sketch out the design of a website, then use an art/design tool such as Photoshop, to paint a view of the website to *sell* that design or layout to a customer.

User Experience Designers focus on how people interface with and interact with the web site. They have a good understanding of accessibility issues, and may focus more on site navigation and organization.  They will often study how people use the site, perhaps presenting something one way to one group, and a different way to another to see which option gets the desired result.

Web Developers often more technical skill and experience with HTML and CSS, as well as with various programming languages, particularly JavaScript.  For larger interactive sites, they may have responsibilities for developing both the web user interface, as well as the back-end data systems. They may also work with various web content management systems to publish and maintain content.

In reality while there may be separate *ideal* roles, but often these responsibilities are blended and blurred across a team.  Some people may do more artistic design, some may focus more on usability, others may focus more on writing the code.  But generally everyone has some expertise in one area, but some ability or knowledge of all. The smaller the project, the more roles one person must fill.



## In-class Design Review & Presentation
Using the information that you learned from the reading in Chapter 3, you will be split into groups and assigned a website from the list below.  Working with your group, you'll review the web site and prepare a short (no more than 5 minute) presentation.

### Review as a Group
Make sure you know who the members of your group are by name.  You will need to know later when you grade each other on participation and teamwork.  

Look at the site as a group - make sure that you all work together.  It’s ok to have one person lead, but everyone should feel like they contribute.  No one should feel like one person did all the work, or that someone coasted along for a free-ride.

Evaluate your assigned site against the design principles and checklist from the end of Chapter 3.  Check the list of things below that I expect you to mention in your presentation.  Try not to focus on personal likes or dislikes, at least not without backing it up with a good design principle the site has or doesn’t have.  Imagine you are giving your “professional” feedback to the company or organization itself as well as the creator of the page.  

### The Presentation
Five minutes.  That’s all the time you get.  Be quick and to the point, but be clear and be professional.  It’s up to your group whether you want to have one person talk or split the time, but it should be “one” review.  You may want to make notes to ensure you cover the key points.

There are a few things you should specifically cover:

- Quickly introduce the entire group to the class.
- Who is the target audience?  Do you think it will appeal to that group?  Why?
- On the main page, is the key information visible when you first view the page or must you scroll?
- Does the site display consistently across Chrome, IE, and Firefox?  
- If you resize the browser window to tablet size (width between 480 and 768) and phone size (width less than 480), is the site responsive? (Do you have to scroll to see the information in the smaller window, or does the site “respond” and reformat the information to be clearly seen in the smaller browser viewport?)   You should actually show this by resizing the browser window for the class.  
- Comment on at least 3-4 other design aspects. Make sure to include things that are positive, along side of anything negative.  Odds are that even the worst site has done something well.  Refer to the checklist at the end of Chapter 3 if you are short on ideas.

## Make-up Design Review Paper
If you are not in-class for the group design review, you may write up a 750-1000 word paper for one of the web sites listed above. You will have one week from the missed class date to submit the paper for credit.

Your write-up should first introduce the site and its purpose, and then cover the same list of items as described for the presentation above. Make sure to use screenshots of the website to clearly illustrate your points.
