title:  Case Study Intro
---

For our first case study, we will be working on a business site for the owner of the Pacific Trails Resort located on the coast of Northern California. The owner, would like a website that emphasizes the uniqueness of the location and accommodations. Currently the discussions on website content are in the preliminary stage, but following [agile project principles](http://agilemanifesto.org), we will get to work right away and revise our design and website code iteratively as the project requirements evolve.

## Wireframes
We have been given some initial content and style information for the the website, but the requirements team is continuing to work with our client on layout details.  The requirements team has been working with the client to create wireframe mock-ups of the proposed site. They are using an online tool called [Moqups](https://moqups.com/) - a tool used to create and share wireframes on the web.

The wireframes will show you the expected content and structure of the web pages. They will be updated for each case study project, as more design specifics are worked out with our client.

## Site Map
The planned site map:

      alt="The site map - a Home Page with sub pages for Yurts, Activities, and Reservations." />

## Due Dates
Make sure to watch the scheduled due dates on D2L. There is about a week between each due date, and a lot of work to do for each one.  Make sure to manage your time wisely.
