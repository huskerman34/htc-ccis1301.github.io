Today in-class, we're going to talk through the design of a mobile first website.  If you are unable to attend class, there is a make-up assignment included as well.  You'll have one week to complete that assignment.

## Why Mobile First?
For many people world-wide, their phone is their only portal to the internet.  They may not have a desktop or laptop computer at all.  The growing number of people that use their mobile device as a primary path to the internet is resulting focus on designing <em>first</em> for mobile devices and enhancing that design for later displays.

A current trend is a single page design, where a single page is sectioned by content into <em>slide</em> or flip-book like areas that you scroll down to.  There is also generally a navigation tool that allows you to quickly move between sections.  This is often used for a main landing page for the site and there may be links to other pages found within that content or in the footer.  

We looked at some examples earlier in the notes for Chapter 3:

### Example 1 - The home page for [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

This site has typical navigation along the top, but the layout of the homepage frames each section to be visually separate as you scroll down the page.

  <img src="{{ "/assets/images/ch3/design-heroku1.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Screen capture of the Tumblr welcome page." />

Scrolling down makes me think of *streaming* content.  It flows from one section to the next, often aided with small animations.

  <img src="{{ "/assets/images/ch3/design-heroku3.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Screen capture of the third section of the Heroku page, obtained by scrolling further down." />

### Example 2 - The welcome page for [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)

Notice the typical banner and navigation are missing from the top of the page.

  <img src="{{ "/assets/images/ch3/design-tumblr1.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Screen capture of the Tumblr welcome page." />

Scrolling down is like flipping a page.  Notice the dots down the left side that indicate where you are, and can be clicked to move forward and back.  

  <img src="{{ "/assets/images/ch3/design-tumblr2.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Screen capture of the next Tumblr page, obtained by scrolling down." />
