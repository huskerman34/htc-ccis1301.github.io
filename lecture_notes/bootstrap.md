# Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a commonly used library of CSS and JavaScript component that make developing web sites easier, as you can use their common components without needing to write your own.  This not only saves you effort, but since these components are used on many sites, it makes it easier to look at another web site that is built on the same foundation and understand how to update and maintain that site.

There are many tutorials on using and learning Bootstrap, and this will be your first test of learning some new web skills fairly independently. Bootstrap is not covered in your textbook, so you will need to find your own resources and examples.  

You will be required to use Bootstrap for your final portfolio project and there will be questions about Bootstrap on the final exam.  


## Bootstrap Website
The best resource for information on Bootstrap is their website: [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) page.  

I recommend you start with their [Getting Started](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) page, beginning with how to add their files to your site from a CDN. [Why use a CDN?  Check here.](https://gtmetrix.com/why-use-a-cdn.html)  Since these files are not "yours" and the CDN already exists, you really have no reason not to. It should result in a faster load of your web site.

Also on the Getting Started page, you will find a [Basic template](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#template), though you will need to modify this template to get the files from the CDN (or download them and include them in your project). There are also some simple [examples](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples).  In this week's assignments, we will be piecing together a few of these examples, so it would be good to spend a little time looking at them.  

## CSS Library
Bootstrap provides some useful CSS that can be used on any page.  You will find details on this under the [CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) section of the site.

Their [grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) is one of the most useful features as it can be easily used to make complex website layouts that are fully responsive to the users device size.  Understanding this grid system is very important to understanding layout in a Bootstrap site, so make sure to spend some time with this.  

You can find layout tools for working with the Bootstrap Grid and other components on the web.  Try a Google search and see what you find. Feel free to share useful resources in the classroom discussion.

## CSS Components
Bootstrap also provides some fairly common [components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) which are a combination of HTML and CSS.  This includes a jumbotron, dropdown lists, buttons, pagination controls, alerts, media layouts, and more. The nice thing with these components is that they work with CSS only, though some are enhanced if JavaScript is also included.

## JavaScript Components
The Bootstrap [JavaScript Components](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/) require JavaScript in order to function, but the nice thing is that you do not have to write this JavaScript code, it is provided for you.  These components include transitions, modal dialogs (pop-ups), tabs, popovers, a carousel, and more.

In the Ms. B's Veggies assignments, we will explore some common Bootstrap controls. These assignments are intended to help you learn Bootstrap, but will only touch on some of the most common pieces.
