## Accessibility Testing
Read the information on Accessibility testing in Chapter 12 of your textbook.  

The textbook identifies 4 different options for automated accessibility testing of websites:

- [WebAim Wave](http://wave.webaim.org/)
- [ATRC AChecker](http://achecker.ca/)
- [Web Developer Extension](http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/)
- [WAT Toolbar](https://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/wat/)

For this assignment you must select two of these tools and show the results of your testing against your Pacific Trails website.

## Test Report & Tool Evaluation
Write a 2-3 page report of your findings using each of the tools.  Include any issues identified with comments on what the issues is, how critical you think it is to resolve, and how you it should be addressed.  You might also highlight things that were done well.

Include at least one paragraph for each tool, describing your experience accompanied by a screenshot showing results obtained from each tool. Conclude the paper with a summary paragraph that wraps up your findings and overall experience.

## Submit the Assignment
The paper should be written in a MS Word (any version), .RTF, or .TXT document and post the file to the assignment dropbox on D2L. (Any other document format that I cannot read will result in no credit.)
