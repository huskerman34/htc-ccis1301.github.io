title: Setup Slack

## Overview
Slack is our online chat and team collaboration tool.  Please watch the video on D2L for an introduction and walk-through on how to join and participate.


## Signup
You'll want to click this link to join: https://htc-ccis1301.slack.com/signup

You will need to use your my.hennepintech.edu email account to join our team.  


## Configure your profile
Once you are signed up and in slack, the first thing that you should do is update your profile. Please update your profile with:

- your first name, or what you prefer to be called
- your last name
- your HTC degree program in the "What I do" field

I also request that you add a picture of yourself to the profile. This helps me to learn to recognize my students, so I can say hello if I bump into you on campus some time.  It also makes the online class a friendlier place.

You'll need a more professional photo for the final project as well, so I encourage you to just bite the bullet and find or take one now that you can use for both. However, it's fine if your Slack profile has a more casual picture too.  I often get photos of people with their kids or pets and that's fine, but imagine you are sending the picture to the person who is picking you up at the airport in some far away place.  Would they recognize you?  

Once you have updated your profile, take a screenshot to submit to the assignment dropbox for the week.  Then make sure to say hello to the class.


## Say hello to the class
The room will fill up gradually over the week, but as each person joins I ask that you  at least put a "hello" out there in the chat. This let's us see that it lives!  When you post your hello, it should go into the public chat room (or channel in Slack talk) for the current semester.

You'll notice multiple _channels_ available when you join.  You should automatically be added to both the _general_ chat (which is read only) and the channel for the current semester.  This chat room is the one you will be using most of the time. If you have a question this is the best place to put it. Your question here can be answered by anyone (myself, another student or our SI), and the answer is so that others with the same question can also see the answer.  

Group chat also supports mentions.  Use @ sign followed by a persons user name to call a specific person's attention to a message. This can be helpful if you want to reply to someone's question or to make sure a specific person sees your post.

There is also a _random_ chat where you may go if you want to have or see any non-HTML or web related conversations.  In the past we've seen interesting posts on games, current events, and just random "how ya doing?" banter.  Use this to keep the course chat channel web related, but also keep the random chat respectful and polite.

One last note on public chat.  This is an extension of a classroom, and you should treat it as such.  This is not to say we can't joke, use emoji and have some fun, but think about how your fellow classmates will view your words before you type them.  Your student code of conduct applies here in the online classroom just as much as it would on campus.


## Direct messages
Slack also supports private messages and conversations with an individual. The direct message conversations are located below the channels.  You should have a conversation going with Slackbot (a bot) when you first join.  This is a conversation only the two of you can see.

If you wish to send a direct message to someone, click the + icon next to the Direct Messages heading to look them up.  When you find them and click go, a new private conversation is started that only the two of you can see.


## Download the App
Slack can be accessed on the web through any web browser.  However it can be more convenient to stay signed-in by using their desktop and/or mobile app.

Downloads for the apps can be found here: https://slack.com/downloads
