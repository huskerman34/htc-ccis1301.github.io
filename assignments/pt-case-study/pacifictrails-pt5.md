  :exclamation: Overall the Pacific Trails Case Study will follow the case study from the textbook, but how we get from beginning to end will be a little different in places. Please use these instructions to direct your work.

This assignment is worth 50 points and will be graded as follows:

- All HTML and CSS files are valid - 10 pts (all or nothing - one error means 0 points for validation)

- Page content is correct (includes spelling, capitalization, correct images, etc.) - 5 pts total

This assignment includes the case study work from Chapters 10, 11 & 12 in your textbook.


Make sure to check the feedback for your previous assignment on GitHub. Note that errors that are not fixed will continue to have points deducted each week.


## GitHub
Continue working with your forked copy of the [ptCaseStudy](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/ptCaseStudy) repository.  There is no need to fork the repository again.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<strong>Do NOT make multiple folders for each section of the assignment.  You want each version to update and add to the same directory and files.</strong><br>
GitHub will track versions of your files at each commit, so you can always go back to any previous committed version. If you would like (this is not required) you may create a release for each part of the assignment.  See this <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/">GitHub Release</a> article for information on how to do this.

## Chapter 10 - Tips
Adding the Reservations page with the form is pretty straightforward. However you should pay attention to the details in the instructions.  Make sure that you have the correct input types specified and configure them reasonably.  You probably don't want a reservation staying 0 nights for example.  Also, many students miss the CSS to stack the label over the input field for the mobile display.

## Chapter 11 - Tips
The addition of the home page video and the nav transition is also fairly straightforward, but many students struggle with the addition of the the image gallery. *Make sure to allow sufficient time for this work.*

Images & Captions:

- photo2.jpg - Rocky Coastline
- photo3.jpg - Clouds Moving in on the Coast
- photo4.jpg - Waterfall Near Big Sur
- photo6.jpg - Sunset on the Coast

Use photo2 as the “placeholder” image on the left, faded out as initial display.  Then on hover, show the larger image for the thumbnail hovered in place of that placeholder image.

It can be very helpful to first work through the Hands On Practice 11.8 on pages 368-369. Make small changes and test as you complete each step. The gallery will look messy until all of the CSS is added, so it is helpful to see the starting point and understand how each change should alter that along the way. If you work through this first with an example that you have solution files for, the gallery in the case study will go much smoother.

## Chapter 12 - Tips
This is a small and simple task, and pretty much the only way to mess it up is to forget to do it, or to forget to add it to all pages.  Write a reasonable description, but don't feel like you need it to be perfect and polished.  It should give the true business owner some idea of what to include, so that they can polish the text for you later.


## Submit the Assignment
When everything looks good, commit your changes and push your files up to GitHub.  Verify your changes have been pushed, then test your updated site on the web.

Retest your links and double check your page layout and display. I also encourage you to re-validate your HTML and CSS using the link to your live page.  Paste the URL from your live page (not the GitHub view of the text) into the W3C Validator - Validate by URI tab.

When everything looks good, create the pull request to have your work graded.

While you can continue working on the case study locally, I encourage you not to push any additional changes to GitHub until the assignment has been graded.  Your pull request will automatically update to include any additional commits that are pushed to GitHub.  Local commits stay local, but pushed commits will update the pull request.
