  :exclamation: Overall the Pacific Trails Case Study will follow the case study from the textbook, but how we get from beginning to end will be a little different in places. Please use these instructions to direct your work.

Make sure to check the feedback for your previous assignment on GitHub. Note that errors that are not fixed will continue to have points deducted each week.


## GitHub
Continue working with your forked copy of the [ptCaseStudy](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/ptCaseStudy) repository.  There is no need to fork the repository again.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<strong>Do NOT make multiple folders for each section of the assignment.  You want each version to update and add to the same directory and files.</strong><br>
GitHub will track versions of your files at each commit, so you can always go back to any previous committed version. If you would like (this is not required) you may create a release for each part of the assignment.  See this <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/">GitHub Release</a> article for information on how to do this.

## Chapter 8 - Tips
Be sure to make any necessary correction from the previous work first. If the layout from Chapter 7 is not correct, the instructions for adding the media query CSS will not work correctly.

I encourage you to do the changes for each layout separately.  First add any changes to the desktop styles & test, then update the tablet styles & test, the update the mobile styles and test.  As the tablet styles build on the desktop and the mobile styles build on the tablet, this will help you troubleshoot any issues.  

Pay attention to the order of the styles for your navigation links. If these are not in the correct order, they will not "cascade" correctly and will not behave the way that you might expect them to.

Double and triple check your spelling, punctuation, and layout. Make sure your site looks professional.

Make sure to beautify (plug-in for Brackets) and validate your files and test your work.  There are images in the textbook to show you what the pages should look like. I would even recommend committing your changes and pushing them to GitHub.

## Chapter 9 - Tips
Adding the table to the Yurts page is pretty straightforward. Pay attention to the instructions however, as many students miss that all table text should be centered, *except* for the description. You will add a style class to un-center, or left-align, the description cell content.

## Submit the Assignment
When everything looks good, commit your changes and push your files up to GitHub.  Verify your changes have been pushed, then test your updated site on the web.

Retest your links and double check your page layout and display. I also encourage you to re-validate your HTML and CSS using the link to your live page.  Paste the URL from your live page (not the GitHub view of the text) into the W3C Validator - Validate by URI tab.

When everything looks good, create the pull request to have your work graded.

While you can continue working on the case study locally, I encourage you not to push any additional changes to GitHub until the assignment has been graded.  Your pull request will automatically update to include any additional commits that are pushed to GitHub.  Local commits stay local, but pushed commits will update the pull request.
