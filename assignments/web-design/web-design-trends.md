title: Review Current Design Trends
---

## Overview
Find an article on the web that discusses current web design trends.  The article must be no more than a year old.

Write up a 1 page summary and review of the article for the dropbox (MS Word or RTF format, if I can't read it I can't grade it), then share your article with a short review in the Slack chat room.  

Everyone must review and post a different article, so please check carefully that you are not duplicating someone else's article.  


## Requirements
Locate a recent (no more than 1 year old) web article that discusses current web site design trends. This must be a blog post or a technical article.

_Important:_ Post your article to the group chat.  Everyone must review and post a different article, so please check carefully that you are not duplicating someone else's article.  


## Review Document
Write a short document that identifies the article that you used (with a link) and gives a short (2-3 paragraph) summary and review of the article.  Include both thoughts on the article itself as well as the trends discussed. If you are looking for ideas, you might review the checklist from Chapter 3 and consider how these trends do and/or do not apply and use those principles.


### GitHub - optional (5 points bonus)
Create a new GitHub repository and post a simple website that illustrates design trends from your article.  You may name it as you like, but for the bonus points, you must post a screenshot of the repository and the live webpage to the dropbox.

Remember: You must push your work to the gh-pages branch for it to be visible as a live website on GitHub.


## Submit the Assignment
You must post your article to the Group Chat on Slack.  Everyone must review a different article.

The review document must be submitted to the dropbox.  For the bonus points, you should include a _separate_ document with a screenshot of the GitHub website illustrating the new design technique(s).  

_Important:_ Create a MS Word (any version) or RTF document for your paper. Any file type that I cannot read will receive no credit for the assignment.
