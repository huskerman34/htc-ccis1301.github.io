title: Focus on Web Design - Part 2
---

## Overview
This will be the second part of our multi-part assignment on web design basics.

Last week you considered your own personal likes and dislikes on the web and learned about some of the things your fellow classmates liked and disliked. This week, we'll continue to consider what we like and don't like by pooling our thoughts as a class, and those thoughts as the foundation of a web design dos and don'ts list.

## Requirements
Review the posts and discussion from last week and use that to build a list of dos and don'ts.  

Your list should be organized by importance (most important at the top) and contain at least 10 dos and 10 don'ts.

Below your list, discuss how you used ideas from the group discussion to build your list.  Identify 3-4 other students whose comments or ideas you used in selecting (or not selecting) the items in your list. Include their name as well a short description of how you used their contribution.  

## Submit the Assignment
Submit your list and discussion in a MS Word (any version), .RTF, or .TXT document and post the file to the assignment dropbox on D2L. (Any other document format that I cannot read will result in no credit.)

## Note on Collaboration
You may continue to discuss the creation of the dos and don'ts list in the chat room.  However, **DO NOT** share your actual dos and don'ts list in the chatroom, at least not until after the assignment due date has passed. At that point you are welcome to share if you like, but it is not required to do so.
