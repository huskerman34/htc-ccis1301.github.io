title: Focus on Web Design - Part 1
---

## Overview
This will be the first of a multi-part assignment on some basics of web design.

We have not yet considered as a class what makes a good website, but everyone has a sense of the things they like and dislike on the web. This assignment will have you reflect on those. Next week, we'll continue to build on this by pooling our thoughts as a class, and then using them as the foundation of a web design dos and don'ts list.

## Requirements
For this assignment, you should select a public site on the internet (in good taste, nothing NSFW) and assess it by answering the following questions:

- What is the URL and name of the site?
- What is the purpose of the site?
- Who is the intended audience?
- Do you think the site reaches its intended audience? Explain why or why not.
- Is the site useful to its intended audience?  Would you encourage others to visit?

In addition to the questions above, think about the site structure and presentation. Focusing more on the site design, usability & structure rather than topic and content, clearly list:

- three things you think this site has done well.
- three things you think this site could do better.
- three things that will cause you to leave a site and go elsewhere (even if not used on this particular site)

As others start posting their site analysis, respond to at least two other posts with a short comment on something you agree or disagree with in their assessment.

### Discussion
Respond to at least two posts made by others before the assignment deadline.  Were their positives and negatives similar to yours?  Were they different?  Do you agree or disagree with their choices?

Try to ensure that everyone's post gets some response and that later posts aren't neglected.  For later posts, it is fine if these responses continue into the following week, but those will not count toward this grade.  Additional responses made above the required two and responses made after the deadline to ensure everyone's post is addressed will reflect on your overall participation grade.

The more discussion you generate as a group, the better your upcoming design dos and don'ts list will be.


## Submit the Assignment
Answer the questions in a MS Word (any version), .RTF, or .TXT document and post the file to the assignment dropbox on D2L. (Any other document format that I cannot read will result in no credit.)

Then post the same information to the Slack chat room for class discussion.  Click the + to create the post as a snippet, a single multi-line post.

Follow up later by updating the dropbox with a separate document showing your response to two other posts.
