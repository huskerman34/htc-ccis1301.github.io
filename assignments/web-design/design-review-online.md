## Design Review
Using the information that you learned from your personal analysis of web site dos and donts and the information on web design provided in Chapter 3 of your text book, you will review one of the websites from the list below.  The specific site for you to review will be assigned to you by this instructor and communicated via email.

|www.arm.gov            |www.alistapart.com      |www.dcmm.org
|www.sedonalibrary.org  |www.japantimes.co.jp    |www.telework.gov
|www.bostonglobe.com    |www.ideamatic.net  

## Review the Site
Look at the site and evaluate your assigned site first against the dos and donts list that you made for the earlier assignment.

- What was your initial reaction to the site?
- Did your thoughts on the site change after spending some time navigating the site and looking over the content?
- How many of your dos are reflected in this website?  
- How many of your donts?

Next review the website against the design principles discussed in Chapter 3 and collected in the design checklist at the end of the chapter.

- Can you identify the target audience for the site?
- Do you think the site appeals to that audience?
- What design choices contribute to the appeal or lack of appeal to the target audience.
- Can you tie things that you like or don't like to the design practices in the checklist?  


## Review Document
Formalize your thoughts in a short 800-1000 word paper (about 2 pages) that covers your thoughts on the web site design. You should try to ensure that your paper is neither too long or too short, however clarity and inclusion of all the required points is equally important. The paper will be graded both on your understanding of web design principles and the presentation of those ideas in your writing. Correct spelling and grammar should be used, and attention should be paid to the organization of your ideas.  

It is important that you keep this review polite and professional. Imagine the review will go back to the site owners and developers, and that they are considering hiring you to refine and improve their site. Show your knowledge and understanding of key web design principles by thoughtfully applying it to their site. In the cases where you see opportunities for improvement, be sure to illustrate those in a professional and positive light.

While you have a lot of freedom in your review, there are a few things you must specifically cover:

- an introduction to the site and its purpose
- the site's target audience
- why the site will appeal to that audience, or how the site can better appeal to it
- visibility of key information without the need to scroll
- the overall experience of the site for a mobile device user

You must also specifically discuss the impact of at least 3 items from the web design best practices checklist in Chapter 3 on the presentation and layout of this website. Select the things that you feel has made the most impact (positive or negative) on the site. Even if you think the design leaves much to be desired, make a point to identify at least one thing that you think they have done well.

_Important:_ Create a MS Word (any version) or RTF document for your paper. Any file type that I cannot read will receive no credit for the assignment.
