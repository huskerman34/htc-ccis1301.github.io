title: Try a CSS Tutorial
---

## Overview
For this assignment, you will search the web for an article that discusses and demonstrates a CSS technique.  The tutorial must be recent, published in the last 2 years, and should be different than something covered in the textbook Hands on Practices that we have seen.

## GitHub
You will create a new GitHub repository for this assignment. You may name it as you like, but must post a screenshot of the repository and the live webpage to the dropbox to receive credit for the assignment.

Remember: You must push your work to the gh-pages branch for it to be visible as a live website on GitHub.

## Requirements
Locate a recent (no more than 2 year old) web article that demonstrates a new CSS technique. This must be a blog post or a technical article, **NOT** a just a simple CSS tutorial page such as this [W3Schools CSS Borders](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp).

### Find an article
Some examples of what I have in mind:

- [How to code a blog theme concept in HTML and CSS](http://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-code-a-blog-theme-concept-in-html-css)
- [12 Awesome CSS3 Features You Can Finally Use](http://tutorialzine.com/2013/10/12-awesome-css3-features-you-can-finally-use/)
- [Techniques for Textured Text](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/12/02/techniques-for-creating-textured-text/)

__Note that you cannot use these.__ Do you see why?  It's not just because I linked them...

### Apply what you learn
Create an HTML page to show that you have applied what you learned from the article. As always, you should double check that your page is valid using the W3C Validators.

Write a Readme file (see the ones for the previous assignments as examples) for your repository that identifies the article that you used (with a link) and gives a short (2-3 paragraph) summary and review of the article.  You will need to say more than just it was good or bad. It is important to explain specifically what you liked or didn't like.


## Submit the Assignment
Creating a new repository and pushing changes to it is a key part of this assignment.  Because you are not forking an existing class repository, you can not create a pull request for me.

When complete, you must post a screenshot of the repository and the live webpage to the dropbox to receive credit for the assignment. Pay attention to the assignment due date found on D2L.
