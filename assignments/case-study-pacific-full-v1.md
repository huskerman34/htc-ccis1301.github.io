<h2>Overview</h2>
The Pacific Trails Case Study is the first web project that we will do for this course.  Please note that while there are instructions at the end of each chapter of the textbook, you should work from these combined and streamlined instructions.  They do not match the book exactly, but are what you will be graded against.
