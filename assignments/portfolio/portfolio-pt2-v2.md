Once the wireframes have been submitted and graded, they are our _contract_ for this assignment. Any suggestions made in the feedback should either be implemented in this final submission unless otherwise negotiated with the instructor. If no wireframes were submitted and the site does not look as expected, points will be deducted.

## Custom Style
Utilize the resources available to you to select a custom color palette, fonts and icons.  Use [Paletton](http://paletton.com/) or a similar site to make a color palette and add a link to that in your footer.  Use [CSS Font Stack](http://www.cssfontstack.com/) to browse and select one or two fonts, setting up appropriate font family properties to ensure good fallback fonts. Optionally use custom bullets with images or icons from [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) or [Bootstrap Glypicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons).

I would recommend that you take the same approach that we used to customize Ms. B's Veggies, and set up your own stylesheet to add and alter styles as needed.  While it is possible to [customize Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/) for download, this process for this can be a little overwhelming and time intensive, especially while you are still finalizing your choices.

## Feedback & Polish
Make sure that you've acted on feedback received so far, and sharing your site in the class chat to get feedback from others. You might be nervous about sharing, but remember everyone is in the same position here and because of that it's probably one of the most friendly groups you'll ever get feedback from.

Ensure your main page (and any additional pages you choose to add - none are required) look polished, professional and complete. Make sure to proof read carefully, and then have someone else proof read for you. This is your online resume, spelling and grammar, punctuation, all make an impression and you want it to be a good one.

## Test & Validate
Check your page by viewing it in the browser, paying particular attention to any differences intended between the mobile, tablet, and desktop presentation.  This is your final chance to review the site before submitting it for your final grade.  

Make sure that you have included all of the required content!

Test validate, then test and validate again just to be sure it's all great.  

## Submit the Assignment
Before you turn your project in:

1. Double check that you have saved all your files and close your editor.

2. Find your project folder in the file system, and open the index.html page in the Chrome browser. Verify that it looks as expected.

3. Verify your navigation links.  You should be able to use the links or scrolling to access different sections on the main page.

4. Next open the web page in a different browser such as Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari. Note any issues you encountered in your dropbox comments, along with resolutions if you fixed the issue.

5. Use the W3C Validator to re-validate the HTML and CSS files.

6. Commit and push to GitHub, then check the display of your site on GitHub. (Link under settings.)  Add a link to the repository description so anyone looking at your GitHub site can easily view it.

## Submit the Assignment
When you are satisfied, zip the project, upload it to the dropbox, submit that pull request, and then celebrate.  :dancer:
