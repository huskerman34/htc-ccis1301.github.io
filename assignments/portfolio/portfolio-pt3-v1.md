## Site Improvements
The focus for this part of the assignment is to wrap finalize and wrap up all of the styling, layout and content.  The finished site should look great on a mobile or tablet device, as well as on a desktop, and should reflect your personal style.  Everyone's final project should look different.

## Feedback & Polish
Make sure that you've acted on feedback received so far, and consider what you've learned from reviewing a different site.  Ensure your main page (and any additional pages you choose to add - none are required) look polished, professional and complete.  They should contain information about you, which you should proof read carefully, and then have someone else proof read for you.  This is your online resume, spelling and grammar, punctuation, all make an impression and you want it to be a good one.

## Test & Validate
Check your page by viewing it in the browser, paying particular attention to any differences intended between the mobile, tablet, and desktop presentation.  This is your final chance to review the site before submitting it for your final grade.  Test validate, then test and validate again just to be sure it's all great!  You don't want to lose any points for forgetfulness.

1. Double check that you have saved all your files and close your editor.

2. Find your project folder in the file system, and open the index.html page in the Chrome browser. Verify that it looks as expected.

4. Next open the web page in a different browser such as Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari. Note any issues you encountered in your dropbox comments, along with resolutions if you fixed the issue.

5. Use the W3C Validator to re-validate the HTML and CSS files.
