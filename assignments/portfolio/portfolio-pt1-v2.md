title: Personal Portfolio - Part 1
---

## Introduction
For our last project, we are going to work on a personal portfolio site that is made using Bootstrap.  Think of it as your online resume. You should design this following the principles of mobile first web design. Plan first how this will look on a phone (never know who you'll bump into at a coffee shop) and then enhance it for a desktop. Bootstrap will help you with this.

You are free to customize the look of the site to suit your own tastes and style, and in fact is it is meant to showcase your style and personality. No two of these final projects should look alike. However, you must include the information required below. Make yourself a checklist and double-check that you do not miss something along the way.

For Part 1 you _must_ submit wireframes and may optionally get initial feedback on your site.

<div class="alert-danger">  
The wireframes are our _contract_ for this assignment. If no wireframes are submitted and the site does not look as expected, points will be deducted. It is in your best interest to do this part well so that we are clear on site layout.

## Site Requirements
The site must contain all of the information below _on a *single* page_.  If you wish to include additional pages with additional supporting information, you can do that. However I must be able to find all of the key information below on the main page.

### Content
You _must_ include the following content:

- Your full name
- A short intro or personal statement (No more than 3 sentences. who are you, what kind of job do you want, etc)
- Link to your GitHub profile using one of Font Awesome's icons for GitHub.
- Section for Technical skills (at the very least you can use a computer and know HTML5/CSS and Bootstrap)
- Section for Projects (see below)
- Section for Education (include school(s), degree(s)/program(s) and a list of relevant courses)
- Footer w/ copyright, link to Paletton color scheme, and optionally an email.

The project section must include a gallery (with image screenshots) that link to your GitHub repository and optionally the live page hosted on GitHub. (If you do not want the live link in the gallery, put it in your repository description.)  At the very least you should have 3 items in the gallery: your Fan Page, Pacific Trails & Ms. B's Veggies. You are also encouraged to upload things from other classes to GitHub and include those as well.

You may optionally also include the following:

- A professional looking picture of yourself (they say it helps leave a good impression)
- Section for Work/Volunteer Experience
- Additional Social Media Links (LinkedIn is a good choice, others only if you want and consider your content there professional)

### Bootstrap components
You _must_ use the following Bootstrap components:

- [Navbar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar)
- [ScrollSpy](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy)
- [Grid System](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid)

### HTML Structure
You must use HTML5 `<article>` and/or `<section>` tags to separate each content area. Add links to each of your content areas () in the Bootstrap [Navbar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar) at the top.

When configured correctly, ScrollSpy will highlight the appropriate link in the Navbar as you scroll down the page. Be sure to test this and ask questions if you are having problems with it. It is expected that you will also use Bootstrap styles to show/hide content, align text, and style images where these styles are available instead of writing your own.


## Wireframes
For the first part of the assignment, you will sketch out your site in a wireframe.  You may use whatever tool you like for this, including pen/paper, but you should submit the completed wireframes to the D2L dropbox.  (So make good scans if you use pen/paper.)  There are several specialized tools you could try for free, or you can use tools like PowerPoint and Visio.

Make sure to consider what you have learned about Bootstrap in the creation of your wireframes. The more you try to alter their standard components the harder this project will be.  

<div class="alert-danger">  
Once the wireframes have been submitted and graded, they are our _contract_ for this assignment. Any suggestions made in the feedback should either be implemented in the final assignment submission or negotiated/discussed w/ the instructor within one week of receiving the feedback.
</div>

If no wireframes are submitted and the site does not look as expected for the final submission, points will be deducted for the missing content and/or appropriate layout.

## HTML Outline
Optionally, you may also submit an outline of the site focusing mainly on HTML and Bootstrap. This is intended to get you some early help using Bootstrap if it is needed, as well as a preliminary review of your site.  The more you have done, the more I can review and give you feedback on.

Consider what we did with Ms. B's website.  It looked pretty ho-hum and standard, right up until that last few minutes as we started tweaking the CSS.  Get the HTML foundation in place, use default Bootstrap components, and later work on making the style unique.

Remember not to get caught up in the content itself.  Use [Lorem ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/) text if needed to avoid getting caught up writing. Use placeholder images, or just a `<div>` with a size, fill and "Image TBD" text for now.  The details can come later. I'm grading on page structure and style, the HTML/CSS and use of Bootstrap, not the personal site content.
