title: Personal Portfolio - Wireframes
name:  portfolio-pt1-v1
---
## Introduction
For our last project, we are going to work on a personal portfolio site.  Think of it as your online resume.  You are free to customize the look of the site to suit your own tastes and style, as it is meant to showcase your style and personality.  However, you must include the information required below.  

## Wireframes
The wireframes will be our _contract_ for this assignment.  They need to be completed to a level that illustrates how you will layout your site to contain the required information.  You will be required to use Bootstrap, but you do not need to use their _template_ layout or look and feel.  These should be submitted in the first week and any corrections should be made and approved before the first part of the assignment is due.

No credit for any part of the project will be given until the wireframes have been completed to a satisfactory level. Be sure to allow at least 2-3 days for the wireframes to be reviewed and any corrections made.

You may either:

- hand-drawn the wireframes and scan or photo them, making sure that the submitted file is sufficiently legible
- create a free Moqups account and create them electronically
- use a different tool (such as Visio, or one of these: [Best Wireframe Tools](http://www.creativebloq.com/wireframes/top-wireframing-tools-11121302))

## Requirements
The following information or sections must be included in your site.  Each of these should be clearly identifiable in the wireframes.

- Personal information: Name, email, a photo (presentable to an employer), optionally a general location (like a city/state or region)
- IT and Soft Skills: Things that you know (like HTML/CSS), and can do (like presentations)
- Project Portfolio: link to your main GitHub page, the Pacific Trails Case Study page, optionally your wireframes and any other projects you would like to include.  I recommend that you maintain and update this as you continue your education.
- Background & Education: where you have/are taking classes, perhaps detailing relevant classes that you have taken, as well as any other information you would want an employer to see and know.

## Submit the Wireframes
The wireframes must be submitted to the dropbox in D2L.  It is also recommended that you include commit them to your GitHub repository so that you can keep them for the future and you might include them as part of your portfolio of projects.

### Changes After Submission
After the wireframes have been submitted and approved (given a passing grade), then any major changes to the design or layout must be approved.  Updated wireframes should be uploaded to D2L and an email sent to the instructor.  Once the changes are approved, you may include them in your project.  If this is, otherwise overall points for the project may be reduced for deviations.
