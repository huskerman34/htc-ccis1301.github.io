## Site Improvements
The focus for this part of the assignment is to improve the overall structure and layout, customize the look and feel, and enhance the site for larger display sizes.  Exactly what you do for this is pretty much up to you, but you must customize the default presentation, and this customization must be unique for your site.  Everyone's final project should look different.

### Custom Style
Utilize the resources available to you to select a custom color palette, fonts and icons.  Use [Paletton](http://paletton.com/) or a similar site to make a color palette and add a link to that in your repository README file.  Use [CSS Font Stack](http://www.cssfontstack.com/) to browse and select one or two fonts, setting up appropriate font family properties to ensure good fallback fonts. Use [Bootstrap Glypicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons) or make a custom font for icons using a site like [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/).

I would recommend that you take the same approach that we used to customize Ms. B's Veggies, and set up your own stylesheet to add and alter styles as needed.  While it is possible to [customize Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/) for download, this process for this can be a little overwhelming and time intensive, especially while you are still finalizing your choices.

### Polished Main Page
At this point, your main page should look polished and complete, and should contain information about you.  It's fine to consider it a draft, and I certainly am not going to verify the information, but make it look personal.  All lorem ipsum text and placeholder images, should be replaced with real content.


## Test & Validate
Check your page by viewing it in the browser, paying particular attention to any differences intended between the mobile, tablet, and desktop presentation.  Ensure that any custom fonts or icons are displaying correctly, and ensure that your color palette and color choices offer enough contrast for good readability.

When you are satisfied, make sure to save and validate all of your files.  You should also test your site with other browsers.  Since the intent is for you to use this as a resume/portfolio, we really should address any issues.  


## Submit the Assignment
Before you turn your project in:

1. Double check that you have saved all your files and close your editor.

2. Find your project folder in the file system, and open the index.html page in the Chrome browser. Verify that it looks as expected.

3. Verify your navigation links.  You should be able to use the links or scrolling to access different sections on the main page.

4. Next open the web page in a different browser such as Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari. Note any issues you encountered in your dropbox comments, along with resolutions if you fixed the issue.

5. Use the W3C Validator to re-validate the HTML and CSS files.

6. Make sure that you edit your README file to include link to a color palette.

When everything looks good, commit and push your files up to GitHub and submit a pull request to have your work graded.  

Then zip the project folder and upload to the D2L dropbox.
