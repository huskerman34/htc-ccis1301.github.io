title:  "Developer Tools Lab 1"
---

## Goals

Use the browser developer tools to:

- view and edit the DOM and HTML structure
- view and edit an element's styles
- identify errors during page load
- measure page load time


## Instructions
For this lab, you will be using the Chrome Developer Tools to peek at the HTML and CSS applied to a web page.  To begin, you'll need to open the page in the Chrome browser:
[Click here to open the lab's web page](http://htc-ccis1301.github.io/dev-tools-lab/).

Create a MS Word (any version) or RTF document for your lab solution. _Important:_ Any file type that I cannot read will receive no credit for the assignment.  

As you go through the tasks below, you will need to both answer any questions and provide a screenshot showing how you got the answer. The screenshots _must_ show both the page content in the browser and the same content in the developer tools. Be sure to clearly label each screenshots with the task that it corresponds to.

### Task 1
Open the Developer Tools and have them docked in the lower portion of the screen.  Make sure the Elements panel is visible.


### Task 2
Locate the head element in the DOM and expand the tree to show all of its child elements.  

How many stylesheets are used on this page?


### Task 3
Locate the header element in the DOM and expand the tree to show all of its child elements.

Select the header and look at the applied CSS.  What CSS is used to add the image to the header?


### Task 4
Locate the element that contains all of the Weekly Specials content in the DOM. Locate the element that contains all of that "yellow" content, not just the header that says "Weekly Specials".

Select that element and expand the tree to show its children.
- What is the name of element used?
- What attributes are on the element?
- How many child elements does it contain?


### Task 5
Locate an h3 element in the DOM and select it. Scroll down so that the heading is visible in the browser as well as the Developer Tools.  Note that when you hover over the h3 element in the Developer Tools, the element on the page is colored in blue and orange.

What does the blue and orange coloring represent?


### Task 6
In the Developer Tools, locate the representation of the CSS box model for the h3 that you selected above.

- What is the size of the h3 content?
- Is there padding applied to the element? If so how much and on which sides?
- Is there a border on the element?  If so what size?
- Is there margin applied to the element? If so how much and on which sides?

### Task 7
What colors are used for the background and the text in the "Our Team" section of the page?


### Task 8
Using the Developer Tools, modify the “Our Team” header to say “Awesome People” and change the text color for only this heading (use an inline style) to black using the appropriate hex code.  

Note: Two very handy hex color codes to know by heart are black and white.  If you don’t know them (and you probably don’t yet), look them up.

### Task 9
Show the JavaScript console.  

Did any errors occur while loading the page?  

### Task 10
How would you find out how long it took to load a resource that this web page required?

- How long did it take to load the Bootstrap stylesheet?

## Submit Assignment
Make sure that you have labeled each task in your document and have saved it as a MS Word or RTF file. Any file type that I cannot read will receive no credit for the assignment.  

Upload the file to the dropbox on D2L.
