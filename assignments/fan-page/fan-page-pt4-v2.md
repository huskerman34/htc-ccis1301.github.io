title: Build a Fan Page - Part 4
---

## Overview
This is part four of the multi-part fan site assignment, where you create a fan page for something you enjoy. (And hopefully enjoy creating it too!)

*Important*: As you build this site, be careful in the use of images, text, and other content from other sources. Unless you have written or created the content yourself, I expect that you will ask for and get permission before using anyone else's material. You should note such permissions near the content or place it in the footer. You should also note copyright of others materials - for example, note the footer on this page [http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/).

## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page).

*Important*: This continues to build on the previous work, so do *NOT* fork the repository again.

## Requirements
For this assignment, you will continue work with your fan site.  

### CSS
Update your CSS file to:

- add margins and padding to add spacing to your pages.  
- add a background image to your header
- use CSS to have one level of sub-headings use text in all capital letters
- add indentation for the first line of each paragraph
- use a gradient background somewhere on the page
- use a 2 column layout - the additional column does not need to be smaller or used for navigation, you can add it to the left or right, and use it for whatever you like - text, images, anything
- set the main content width to 80% of the page and center it (using margins)
- use centered text somewhere on the page (but not for paragraphs, lots of text is hard to read if centered.)
- give some element a visible rounded border
- use a semi-transparent background or text color on the page.


## Submit the Assignment
Before submitting the assignment, you should double check that your both of your HTML and CSS pages are valid by using the appropriate W3C Validator.  

When complete, the assignment must be submitted using a GitHub pull request with a screen shot of that pull request placed in the D2L dropbox.  Pay attention to the assignment due date found on D2L.
