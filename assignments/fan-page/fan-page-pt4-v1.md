title: Build a Fan Page - Part 4
---

## Overview
This is part four of the multi-part fan site assignment, where you create a fan page for something you enjoy. (And hopefully enjoy creating it too!)

*Important*: As you build this site, be careful in the use of images, text, and other content from other sources. Unless you have written or created the content yourself, I expect that you will ask for and get permission before using anyone else's material. You should note such permissions near the content or place it in the footer. You should also note copyright of others materials - for example, note the footer on this page [http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/).

## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page).

*Important*: This continues to build on the previous work, so do *NOT* fork the repository again.

## Requirements
For this assignment, you will continue work with your two fan site pages/styles.  

### Both Styles
Update your CSS files (both the main and alternate) to:

- add margins and padding to add spacing to your pages.  
- make your main heading (header/h1) stand out by giving it a contrasting background color with rounded corners, drop-shadow for the text, and a background image

Apply the margin and padding in different ways so that the main style layout is different than the alternate style.


### Main Style Only
Update your main page CSS file to include (at a minimum) the following items:

- CSS to have one level of sub-headings use text in all capital letters
- indentation for the first line of each paragraph
- use a gradient background color somewhere on the page

### Alternate Style Only
Update your alternate CSS file to:

- change the main heading (header/h1) to have rounded corners
- set the main content width to 80% of the page and center it (using margins)
- use centered text in the footer
- add a visible rounded border around the paragraphs
- make the background color on the paragraphs semi-transparent so the background image shows through.


## Submit the Assignment
Before submitting the assignment, you should double check that your both of your HTML and CSS pages are valid by using the appropriate W3C Validator.  

When complete, the assignment must be submitted using a GitHub pull request with a screen shot of that pull request placed in the D2L dropbox.  Pay attention to the assignment due date found on D2L.
