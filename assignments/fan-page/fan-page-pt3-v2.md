title: Build a Fan Page - Part 3
---

## Overview
This is part three of the multi-part fan site assignment, where you create a fan page for something you enjoy: a movie, game, band, or even your favorite restaurant.  

*Important*: As you build this site, be careful in the use of images, text, and other content from other sources. Unless you have written or created the content yourself, I expect that you will ask for and get permission before using anyone else's material. You should note such permissions near the content or place it in the footer. You should also note copyright of others materials - for example, note the footer on this page [http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/).

## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page).

*Important*: This builds on the assignment from last week, so do *NOT* fork the repository again.

Unless you are working on a different computer or have deleted the files, you also do not need to clone the repository again. Continue working with the same directory and files that you worked with previously. Just use the git add, commit and push commands when you are done to update GitHub.

## Requirements
For this assignment, you will continue work with your alternate fan site styles.  

### Add an image
Update your web page to include a <div> that includes a small thumbnail image that is also a link to a larger version of the same image.

### Both Styles
Update your CSS files (both the main and alternate) to include (at a minimum) the following items:

- a different font (use a font family) for the body text 
- a different font for the headings
- a smaller, but still readable, font size for the footer text
- use italics for the footer text
- use a different list marker for each stylesheet
- bold and increase the font size for your link to the other page/style
- use a background image configured for the body
- use a solid background color for the paragraphs content so that they are more readable over the background image.

### CSS Font Stack
Use the [CSS Font Stack](http://www.cssfontstack.com/) site to help you choose a good font family list. This site provides font availability information for different operating systems and allows you to copy a pre-configured list font-family list for commonly used fonts. It is a great resource to bookmark and use.


## Submit the Assignment
Before submitting the assignment, you should double check that your both of your HTML and CSS pages are valid by using the appropriate W3C Validator.  

When complete, the assignment must be submitted using a GitHub pull request with a screen shot of that pull request placed in the D2L dropbox.  Pay attention to the assignment due date found on D2L.
