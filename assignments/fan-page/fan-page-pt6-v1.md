title: Build a Fan Page - Part 6
---

## Overview
This is the final part the multi-part fan site assignment, where you create a fan page for something you enjoy. (And hopefully enjoy creating it too!)

*Important*: As you build this site, be careful in the use of images, text, and other content from other sources. Unless you have written or created the content yourself, I expect that you will ask for and get permission before using anyone else's material. You should note such permissions near the content or place it in the footer. You should also note copyright of others materials - for example, note the footer on this page [http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/).

## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page).

*Important*: This continues to build on the previous work, so do *NOT* fork the repository again.

## Requirements
For this assignment, you will continue work with your fan site, finalizing your main page.  

### Main Index Page
Update your main page to have a responsive layout that works for mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

You may also clean up the site and make it look as you like without all my crazy style requirements.  Aim to have a nice polished site that can be used to show off your web site design and development skills.


## Submit the Assignment
Before submitting the assignment, you should double check that your both of your HTML and CSS pages are valid by using the appropriate W3C Validator.  

When complete, the assignment must be submitted using a GitHub pull request with a screen shot of that pull request placed in the D2L dropbox.  Pay attention to the assignment due date found on D2L.
