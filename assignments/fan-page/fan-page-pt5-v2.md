title: Build a Fan Page - Part 5
---

## Overview
This is part five of the multi-part fan site assignment, where you create a fan page for something you enjoy. (And hopefully enjoy creating it too!)

*Important*: As you build this site, be careful in the use of images, text, and other content from other sources. Unless you have written or created the content yourself, I expect that you will ask for and get permission before using anyone else's material. You should note such permissions near the content or place it in the footer. You should also note copyright of others materials - for example, note the footer on this page [http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/).

## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page).

*Important*: This continues to build on the previous work, so do *NOT* fork the repository again.

## Requirements
For this assignment, you will continue work with your fan site, polishing your main page.  

### Responsive layout
Update your main page to have a responsive layout that works for mobile, tablet and desktop devices.  Make sure that your design looks good on each device size.  Your points will be based in part (2 points each size) on subjectively how nice the site looks.

### Color Palette
Take some time to explore tools to design a color palette, such as [Paletton](http://paletton.com/).  Set up a web page to show a color scheme of your choosing (or link to a page that does that on Paletton).  If you want to make your own page, you can do this by giving a few different div elements a size and background color. Then adding text to those divs to show the color code.  This page doesn't need to be fancy, just informative.  Add a link to this page to your fan page footer.

You may also clean up the site and make it look as you like without all my crazy style requirements. Anything you don't like from before, you are free to remove. Aim to have a nice polished site that can be used to show off your web site design and development skills.  You want to feel comfortable adding this page to your web portfolio at the end of the class.

### Use an icon font
Use an icon font somewhere on the page.  This can be a social media icon (such as GitHub) or something cute used for bullets or some other decoration.  Icon fonts are not covered in the textbook, but are in the Notes for this week.


## Submit the Assignment
Before submitting the assignment, you should double check that your both of your HTML and CSS pages are valid by using the appropriate W3C Validator.  

When complete, the assignment must be submitted using a GitHub pull request with a screen shot of that pull request placed in the D2L dropbox.  Pay attention to the assignment due date found on D2L.
