title: Build a Fan Page - Part 5
---

## Overview
This is part five of the multi-part fan site assignment, where you create a fan page for something you enjoy. (And hopefully enjoy creating it too!)

*Important*: As you build this site, be careful in the use of images, text, and other content from other sources. Unless you have written or created the content yourself, I expect that you will ask for and get permission before using anyone else's material. You should note such permissions near the content or place it in the footer. You should also note copyright of others materials - for example, note the footer on this page [http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/).

## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page).

*Important*: This continues to build on the previous work, so do *NOT* fork the repository again.

## Requirements
For this assignment, you will continue work with your fan site, polishing your main page.  

### Main Index Page
Update your main page to have a basic two-column layout with a vertical nav bar as shown on pages 222 - 225 in your textbook.   

Configure your nav with a unordered list and include a link to your alt page, any other pages you would like to add for your site, and the external website for your favorite thing. Setup CSS to remove the underlines from your navigation links, specify different font colors for visited and non-visited links, and use block display for a larger click area.

Configure your header to extend the full width of your page, removing any rounded corners.  Use fixed positioning to keep your header visible at the top of the page, even when the page content scrolls.  Note that you may need to add a top-margin to your body element to ensure that the header does not hide your page content.


## Submit the Assignment
Before submitting the assignment, you should double check that your both of your HTML and CSS pages are valid by using the appropriate W3C Validator.  

When complete, the assignment must be submitted using a GitHub pull request with a screen shot of that pull request placed in the D2L dropbox.  Pay attention to the assignment due date found on D2L.
