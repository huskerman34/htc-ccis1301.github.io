title: Build a Fan Page - Part 1
---

## Overview
This will be the first of a multi-part assignment in which you will create a fan page for something you enjoy: a movie, game, band, or even your favorite restaurant.  You can choose the topic, but you must make sure that your page also meet the requirements found in each part of the assignment.

*Important*: As you build this site, be careful in the use of images, text, and other content from other sources. Unless you have written or created the content yourself, I expect that you will ask for and get permission before using anyone else's material. You should note such permissions near the content or place it in the footer. You should also note copyright of others materials - for example, note the footer on this page [http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/).

## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page).

The repository is initially empty, except for the standard Readme.md and .gitignore files and an empty index.html file.

## Requirements
For this assignment, you must update the index.html file so that it contains valid HTML, and add an external stylesheet with valid CSS.

### HTML
The content of the page should include:

- The name of your favorite thing you are building the site for
- A link to a website or other information about this thing. (You must link to another public website.)
- A summary of what this thing is and what you like about it.
- A list of something (ordered or unordered) related to this thing.
- A header with the site name
- At least two subheadings.
- A footer with copyright information.  You own the copyright to your own page, so use your name and the current year.
- An email contact link for you in the footer.  To avoid putting your real email on the page you can use yourFirstName@yourLastName.com or something like that, so long as it is a proper email link.

Do not neglect the <head> section just because it is not visible on the web page. You should include a title and the charset.

### CSS
Add a new external stylesheet called style.css to your project. (Your project is the fan-page directory and all the files in it that make up your website.)

Update your index.html page to use your new stylesheet.

Update the CSS to include (at a minimum) the following items:

- a new document background color
- a new default document text color
- an alternate text color for one level of headings (h1, h2, etc.)
- an alternate background color for some element on the page that is identified using an id
- an alternate text color that is applied to some text using a <span> element and a style class

## Submit the Assignment
Before submitting the assignment, you should double check that your page is valid using the W3C HTML Validator. Validation errors will reduce the points received for your assignments.

When complete, the assignment must be submitted using an open GitHub pull request.  In the D2L dropbox add a screen shot of both the pull request & the live web page hosted on GitHub.
