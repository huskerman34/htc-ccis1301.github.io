title: Build a Fan Page - Part 2
---

## Overview
This is part two of the multi-part fan site assignment, where you create a fan page for something you enjoy: a movie, game, band, or even your favorite restaurant.  

*Important*: As you build this site, be careful in the use of images, text, and other content from other sources. Unless you have written or created the content yourself, I expect that you will ask for and get permission before using anyone else's material. You should note such permissions near the content or place it in the footer. You should also note copyright of others materials - for example, note the footer on this page [http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/).

## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page).

*Important*: This builds on the assignment from last week, so do *NOT* fork the repository again.

Unless you are working on a different computer or have deleted the files, you also do not need to clone the repository again. Continue working with the same directory and files that you worked with previously. Just use the git add, commit and push commands when you are done to update GitHub.

## Requirements

### HTML Updates
Add a small thumbnail image that is also a link to a larger version of the same image.

### CSS Updates
Make the following additions to your CSS:

- a different font (use a font family) for the body text in each stylesheet. See the note on CSS Font Stack below.
- a different font for the headings
- a italics and smaller, but still readable, font size for the footer text
- use a different list marker
- bold and change the color of the link to the other website
- add margins and padding to add spacing to your pages.  
- make your main heading (header/h1) stand out by giving it a contrasting background color with rounded corners
- add drop-shadow for the text one level of headings
- add a background image to some element on the page


### CSS Font Stack
Use the [CSS Font Stack](http://www.cssfontstack.com/) site to help you choose a good font family list. This site provides font availability information for different operating systems and allows you to copy a pre-configured list font-family list for commonly used fonts. It is a great resource to bookmark and use.
