title: Build a Fan Page - Part 2
---

## Overview
This is part two of the multi-part fan site assignment, where you create a fan page for something you enjoy: a movie, game, band, or even your favorite restaurant.  

*Important*: As you build this site, be careful in the use of images, text, and other content from other sources. Unless you have written or created the content yourself, I expect that you will ask for and get permission before using anyone else's material. You should note such permissions near the content or place it in the footer. You should also note copyright of others materials - for example, note the footer on this page [http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/).

## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page).

*Important*: This builds on the assignment from last week, so do *NOT* fork the repository again.

Unless you are working on a different computer or have deleted the files, you also do not need to clone the repository again. Continue working with the same directory and files that you worked with previously. Just use the git add, commit and push commands when you are done to update GitHub.

## Requirements
For this assignment, you will design two alternate CSS files to improve the display of your web fan site.  

### Style 1
Add a new external stylesheet called style.css to your project. (Your project is the fan-page directory and all the files in it that make up your website.)

Update your index.html page to use your new stylesheet.

Update the CSS to include (at a minimum) the following items:

- a new document background color
- a new default document text color
- an alternate text color for one level of headings (h1, h2, etc.)
- an alternate background color for some element on the page that is identified using an id
- an alternate text color that is applied to some text using a <span> element and a style class

Check the display of your page in the browser to ensure that it looks as you expect.

Then validate your CSS file using the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### Style 2
Make a copy of your index.html page in the same directory and name it index-alt.html.

Make a copy of your style.css file and name it style-alt.css.

Update your index-alt.html page to refer to the style-alt.css file.

Modify your style-alt.css file to use different colors than the original file.  Do not add or remove any other CSS.

Check the display of your alternate page in the browser to ensure that it looks as you expect, and validate your alt CSS file using the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).


## Submit the Assignment
Before submitting the assignment, you should double check that your both of your HTML and CSS pages are valid by using the appropriate W3C Validator.  

When complete, the assignment must be submitted using a GitHub pull request with a screen shot of that pull request placed in the D2L dropbox.  Pay attention to the assignment due date found on D2L.


## Wrap-up
Notice that the same HTML content is displayed differently, just by using a different CSS file. While our CSS for this exercise is rather simple, this illustrates the benefits and power of CSS.

Take some time to visit the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/), where this same principle is applied in a much more dramatic way. An interesting way to contribute to the chat room this week might be to share your favorite Zen Garden design.
