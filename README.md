## Welcome!
This is a template course web site built using Bootstrap, so it's responsive for multiple device sizes.  To customize it for a class, change the **_config.yml** file (don't like orange?  switch it there) and update each of the files in the **sections** folder with information specific to your class.  You can also add custom CSS to the **_sass/custom-scss.scss** file.

Each semester's material can be added as a new page into the **_semesters** folder.  I've got it set up to generate each session's information for that semester from the YML frontmatter in the markdown page.  No other content is needed.  There's a sample of what I have set up in the 2015_3_Fall.md file, and you can see how that is used to generate the page by looking at the **_layouts/semester.html** file.
